Overview</a></h2>
<p>
The M3G Viewer is a Java application for viewing Mobile 3D Graphics data.
The Mobile 3D Graphics API (JSR-184) is a standardized Java ME API for
3D graphics development. The API defines the <i>javax.microedition.m3g</i>
package and is intended to support a wide range of mobile devices, even
those that do not support floating-point mathematics (i.e. CLDC 1.0).
</p>
<p> The M3G API is designed to address several use cases including gaming, map 
  visualization, and product visualization. The Mobile 3D Graphics 1.0 API supports 
  scene graph mode (i.e. high-level) and also immediate mode (i.e. low-level) 
  rendering. The API includes support for single camera (i.e. your point-of-view 
  in the 3D viewing area) with fog, light, meshes, and materials. One of the most 
  important features of the API is its ability to load external 3D models and 
  scenes composed from 3rd-party tools, such as Autodesk's 3ds Max or Newtek's 
  Lightwave3D. These external applications are used to output data to the .m3g 
  file format. </p>
<p>
The M3G Viewer is used to view the contents of the .m3g file format.
</p>
<h2>Components of the M3G Viewer</h2>
<p>
The M3G Viewer project includes the following components:
</p><p>
<ul>
<li><b>The M3G Toolkit</b> - This toolkit is an SDK for developing Mobile 3D
Graphics applications and tools. It implements the M3G Specification
(JSR-184) for PC platforms. It is completely written in the Java programming
language.</li>
<li><b>The M3G Viewer</b> - This application is a tool for viewing data in the
.m3g file format, as defined by the JSR-184 specification. The M3G viewer
is also written entirely in the Java programming language.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>M3G Toolkit</h3>
<p>
The M3G Toolkit implements version 1.1 of the Mobile 3D Graphics API.
This specification, also referred to as <b><i>JSR-000184 Mobile 3D Graphics
API for J2ME</i></b>, can be found
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr184/index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p> Note that the namespace for the classes in this toolkit have been changed 
  from <i>javax.microedition.m3g</i> to <i>com.wizzer.m3g</i>. This was done because 
  the M3G toolkit is not a complete implementation of the JSR-184 specification 
  and has not been verified against the M3G TCK.</p>
<p>To facilitate rendering the .m3g file scene graph, a simple MIDP Emulator has 
  been added in this version of the M3G Toolkit. The Graphics3D node has been 
  added to flesh out the M3G API and can be used by a midlet targeting the MIDP 
  Emulator. </p>
<h3>M3G Viewer</h3>
The M3G Viewer is an application written on top of the Eclipse Rich Client
Platform (RCP) from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>.
It has initially been deployed as a standalone application. However, in the
near future, it will also be deployed as a plug-in extension for Eclipse.
</p>
<p> The viewer allows M3G developers to view the contents of a .m3g file. The 
  user is able to view the .m3g data as it is layed out in the file as Scene Sections. 
  An alternative view of the .m3g data is also provided for browsing the structure 
  of the M3G scene graph. A properties view displays the attributes of each node 
  in the scene graph. In addition to viewing the contents of the .m3g file, the 
  user may select nodes in the scene graph and export them individually into thier 
  own file. The resulting file will contain all relevant dependencies to reconstruct 
  the exported node. Finally, this tool allows the user to dump the .m3g data 
  as an ASCII text file. </p>
<p> Version 0.3 introduces a major new feature: the M3G Viewer can render the 
  scene graph into a 3rd view, giving the user a visual confirmation of the M3G 
  data (without having to import the scene graph into a 3rd-party modelling/animation 
  tool). The renderer is built on top of JOGL, the <a href="http://jogl.dev.java.net">Java 
  Binding for the OpenGL API (JSR-231)</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to fixing bugs, the next version of the M3G Viewer will provide 
  a mechanism for editing the nodes in the M3G scene graph. Future plans include 
  plug-ins for converting data from 3rd-party formats (i.e. Collada). This tool 
  is currently being used to inspect models used by the Magic Lantern project 
  (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wz-mle/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wz-mle/</a>).
