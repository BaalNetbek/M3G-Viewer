<h1 align="center">M3G Viewer User Manual</h1>
<p>This document provides information for using the M3G Viewer. <a href="#Figure1">Figure 
  1</a> shows what the user interface should look like upon executing the browser, 
  <em>M3gViewer.exe</em>. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/Figure1.png" width="840" height="560
"> 
</p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Figure 1: M3G Viewer<a name="Figure1"></a></strong></em></p>
<p align="left"><a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a> shows four main views: the <strong>File 
  View</strong>, the <strong>Gaph View</strong>, the <strong>Properties</strong> 
  view, and the <strong>Console</strong>. The File View is used to inspect the 
  contents of the <em>.m3g</em> file as it is structured in the file. The Graph 
  View is used to inspect the structure of the scene graph and the relationship 
  between the M3G Objects. The Properties view is used to browse the properties 
  of each M3G Object and the Console is used to display messages resulting from 
  using the M3G Viewer.</p>
<p align="left">To view a .m3g file, simply open a file on your system using the 
  <strong>File-&gt;Open</strong> menu item (see <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../images/Figure2.png" width="840" height="560"></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Figure 2: File Menu<a name="Figure2"></a></strong></em></p>
<p align="left">The <strong>Open</strong> action will bring up a File Browser 
  dialog panel, enabling you to select a .m3g file from your platform's file system. 
  Once you open a file, the .m3g file will be analysed and the contents will be 
  displayed in both the File and Graph Views. You can switch between views by 
  selecting the tab item at the top of each view. <a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> 
  shows content being displayed in the Graph View, while <a href="#Figure4">Figure 
  4</a> shows content being displayed in the File View.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../images/Figure3.png" width="840" height="560"></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Figure 3: Graph View with Properties displaying 
  Texture2D selection<a name="Figure3"></a></strong></em></p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../images/Figure4.png" width="840" height="560"></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Figure 4: File View with Properties displaying Camera 
  selection<a name="Figure4"></a></strong></em></p>
<p align="left">Note that <a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> and <a href="#Figure4">Figure 
  4</a> also display Properties from the selected node in each view. The Properties 
  view will be dynamically updated as the user selects M3G Objects in either the 
  File or Graph View. The Properties view displays the attributes of each node 
  in the selected object's hierarchy. For example, the Texture2D object in <a href="#Figure3">Figure 
  3</a> is derived from the Transformable object, which in turn is derived from 
  the Object3D object. The Properties view is displaying the attributes of each 
  of these objects since Texture2D inherits the attributes of its parents, the 
  Transformable and Object3D objects. To understand the context of these attributes, 
  please refer to the M3G Specification.</p>
<p align="left">In <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>, the <strong>File-&gt;Dump</strong> 
  menu item is used to export the contents of the .m3g file to an ASCII text file. 
  This feature is useful for getting detailed information about each M3G Object 
  without attempting to extract it from the Properties view. For instance, the 
  contents of the VertexBuffer contains large arrays of values that are easier 
  to read from the ASCII file than inspecting them via the Properties view.</p>
<p align="left">A useful feature of the M3G Viewer is to extract individual objects 
  from the scene graph into thier own file. For example lets assume that the user 
  wants to create a valid .m3g file containing only the data representing a Mesh 
  node and its dependencies (i.e. Appearance, VertexArray, VertexBuffer, etc.). 
  This can be done by right-clicking on the object and selecting the <strong>Export</strong> 
  item in the pop-up context menu (see <a href="#Figure5">Figure 5</a>). The Export 
  action will bring up a Export Wizard providing the user with an interface for 
  creating the new .m3g file (see <a href="#Figure6">Figure 6</a>).</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../images/Figure5.png" width="840" height="560"></p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>Figure 6: The M3G Object Export Wizard<a name="Figure6"></a></strong></em></p>
<p align="left">Version 0.3 of the M3G Viewer introduces a 3rd view for visualizing 
  the .m3g file scene graph. After the .m3g file is loaded, the user may render 
  the scene graph by selecting the <strong>Display</strong> menu item in the File 
  or Graph view's pull-down menu (see <a href="#Figure7">Figure 7</a>). The current 
  scene graph will be rendered, presenting the data in a 3D view (see <a href="#Figure8">Figure 
  8</a>). If the M3G Viewer is occluded by another window, sometimes the 3D Display 
  will not be refreshed when the window is brought to the top of the window stack. 
  In this case, use the <strong>Refresh</strong> menu item in the File or Graph 
  view's pull-down menu to update the display. </p>

<p align="left">Finally, to exit the M3G Viewer when you are done browsing the 
  content of your .m3g file, simply choose <strong>File-&gt;Exit</strong> from 
  the drop-down menu (see <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>).</p>
